# Taskify Frontend with Vue.js

## Project Overview

**Description:**

This project involves developing a frontend user interface for the Taskify platform, enabling users to manage their tasks using functionalities provided by the previously developed REST API.

**Project Context:**

Taskify has established an API for task management. The objective now is to deliver a modern user interface facilitating user interaction with tasks. The aim is to provide a seamless user experience while maximizing task management efficiency.

**Objective:**

The primary goal is to create a responsive frontend user interface allowing users to interact with Taskify's task management features. The interface should ensure an intuitive and efficient experience for users.

**Key Features:**

- **Task Display:** Show the user's task list with details such as title, description, due date, etc.
- **Task Creation:** Enable users to create new tasks by providing necessary details through an intuitive form.
- **Task Modification:** Allow users to edit existing task details like title, description, or due date.
- **Task Deletion:** Provide functionality for users to remove tasks they no longer need to manage.
- **Task Completion/Incomplete Marking:** Allow users to mark tasks as completed or incomplete to track their progress.

**Required Technologies:**

- **Vue.js Framework:** Utilize Vue.js for frontend development, leveraging its reactivity and component-based architecture.
- **Axios:** Use Axios for making asynchronous HTTP requests to the Taskify API and handling task data retrieval.
- **HTML/CSS:** Employ HTML5 and CSS3 for structuring and styling the user interface.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the user interface adapts seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes.

## User Stories:

1. As a user, I want to view my current task list upon logging into the application.
2. As a user, I want to create a new task by providing a title, description, and due date.
3. As a user, I want to modify existing task details if needed.
4. As a user, I want to delete tasks that I no longer need to manage.
5. As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed or incomplete to monitor their progress.

## Technical Details:

- **Vue.js Components:** Develop frontend components using Vue.js, emphasizing modularity and reusability.
- **Axios Integration:** Integrate Axios to handle asynchronous HTTP requests to the Taskify API for task data manipulation.
- **Responsive Components:** Design responsive and interactive Vue components to ensure a smooth user experience across devices.
- **State Management:** Implement efficient state management to handle task data and user interactions effectively.
- **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests to verify the proper functioning of Vue components.

**Note:** Comprehensive documentation and setup instructions will be available in the project repository.
